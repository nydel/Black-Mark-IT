# Black-Mark-IT
Alpha 1.101 of BlackMarkIT

# Basic Description

A Commonlisp game of MMO Role Play starring a corrupt Vice President of an ethically dark-grey corporation called Black Mark Information Technologies. Sell drugs, weapons, and people. Exploit human weakness, defraud charities, profit from war, famine & death. Commit crimes ranging in severity from petty to horrific to unspeakable against NPCs and other VP's alike in order to claw your way to first in line for the position of President.

# Inspiration And Further Media

The game is inspired by exploitation cinema from the late 1960s to present day. We think most games about criminal practices miss the mark and limit the imagination. The simple situation we posit to make possible our game is designed to create a world in which one can constantly lower the floor on acceptable morality and indulge in increasingly repugnant behaviors.

# Backstory: Black Mark&reg; Information Technologies LLC, Inc.
Sam Madderson Sr. founded Black Mark IT in 1979 and holds the Presidency. He took Coma in December of 2012. His son, Sam Jr. is Interim President. Mr. Madderson was always greedy, hostile & ruthless in business, but his son is a proud self-proclaimed and redundantly-demonstrated confirmed psychopath.

# Strategic Gameplay in the BlackMarkIT World

Begin by setting up drug hustles in Marijuana, Cocaine and Heroin. Let your NET WORTH and LIQUIDITY grow so you can expand.

Once your ill-gotten gains stablize, start using your network, money and influence to exploit people in whatever way you see fit: Start a Cult - Bribe a Government Official - Participate in Satanic Blood Magic - Get involved in Human Trafficking - Grow petitions to introduce laws that effect global lowering of standards regarding morality and ethics!

Start a family with the premeditate intention of slaughtering them all in front of your enemies. It's your life, do whatever you want with it! And more literally than usual - i.e. BlackMarkIT's demographic is programmers who play video games, and we encourage all players to expand the game to increase its GRINDHOUSE value.
